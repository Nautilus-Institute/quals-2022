Hoju has participated in CTFs since 2007 and has been stoking the fires of his love/hate relationship with Vegas since DEF CON 15.

He has written some challenges here or there, but his primary focus has been on developing CTF game visuals in Unreal Engine and attempting to be a DJ for a weekend to make sure attendees are thoroughly entertained.
