Why are you messaging me so much? 
Are you trying to hack me?

What is your fav type of shell? 
I'm not going to just give you the flag, you know, you have to actually hack for it

this isn't even my final message

I'd just like to interject for a moment.  What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. 
This is the year of the linux desktop 
Your doing it wrong. *You’re 
Perhaps you should take up gardening instead! 
I could tell you not to give up but we both know how this is going to end. 
You know, this is the easy version right? 
Try SQL injecting, I hear that is the cool thing to do. 
You should try watching Mr. Robot again. 
Have you heard of tracert? 
Since you aren’t doing anything useful check out the BIOS Operation instruction. 
Please, don’t message the mods because you are failing. You are the Karen of hackers. 
#> 
Real hackers only run gentoo compiled from scratch. 
My other OS is TempleOS. 
Have you tried turning it off and on again? 
flags’ OR 1=1-- 
alert(flag); 
Me too thanks 
Oh look, it’s trying to hack! Bless it’s little heart...

Firefox is a better browser btw 
Make sure to update your browser!

Wow what a great message. I’m impressed you managed to type all that by yourself! Great job! 
Stanley began typing a message to the admin, but he didn’t know if the admin would actually respond. After all the admin might be very busy, or maybe the admin was asleep right now. But the admin did respond. In fact the admin responded so quickly there is no way they could have typed this all out. “Thats odd” thought Stanley, “how could the admin have managed to send a message this long in such a short period of time?” And then he realized the horrifying truth: There is no admin. Stanley had been talking to a computer this whole time. “oh god” Stanley uttered as he fell back with his head in his hands. He had wasted so much time writing out these heart-felt messages, and for what? A computer generated response? Was that really what he was spending his valuable time on? 
Any lunch orders? 
Am I alive? 
Is anything real? 
What even is a computer 
I wish there was a mobile version of this app 
 i wish this was a normal web challenge, like a sql injection :( 
Don’t forget to take a break and go outside 
Can you pet your cats for me, thanks 
I hope you are looking at the network traffic 
Based? Based on what? 
You are telling me a shrimp fried this app 
Excuse me, but could you please stop hacking me? Thank you.
Hey, hacker! Your skills are pathetic! You can't even hack properly!
You really think you're anonymous, don't you? I can see your real name and address right now.
If you can't hack it, maybe you should get a new job.
You are so close to landing that exploit! Keep up the good work and you'll be rewarded for your efforts.
Good job! You're almost there. Keep up the good work and you'll soon be a master hacker!
You are so good at technology! You are always ahead of the curve when it comes to the latest gadgets and gizmos. You make it look so easy!
You are really good at this! You must be some sort of genius.
Hello, I noticed that you have been hacking into my computer and I would appreciate if you would stop. Thank you.
Satoshi was a brilliant young hacker who had successfully hacked into dozens of systems. He was always careful to cover his tracks, using multiple proxy servers and encrypting his data. But one day, he made a mistake. He left one of his files unencrypted on a server he had hacked into, and the authorities were able to trace it back to him. He was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison.
have you tried refreshing?
have you tried alt+f4
dont give up! I believe in u
I can't believe you are reading all of these after the ctf!
